# Data Management

One key ingredient of data science is collection, processing and loading the needed data.
This steps are highly use-case dependent and thus we will mostly talk about general concepts i.e. how to handle
tabular data and some examples on exploratory data analysis.
In this part we will talk about the following topics:

- [Loading](loading_data/) and [saving](saving_data/) tabular data
- [Exploratory data analysis](exploratory_da/)
- [Data sets](datasets/) and non-tabular data

# Loading data into dataframes

Data science mostly requires to work with tabular data. With [`DataFrames.jl`](https://dataframes.juliadata.org/stable/), Julia provides a set of tools for loading, exploring, and manipulating tabular data. When you are already familiar with `pandas` (Python) or `dplyr` (R) you will be quickly able to get started with data wrangling using `DataFrames.jl`, since design and functionality are quite similar. Before we actually work with a given data set, we need to understand how to read and store it.

First of all, you need to add and load the package:
```julia-repl
pkg> add DataFrames
julia> using DataFrames
```

Let us start with an empty `DataFrame`:
```julia-repl
julia> DataFrame()
0×0 DataFrame
```

It is also easy to initialize a `DataFrame` with a couple of columns:
```julia-repl
julia> DataFrame(
           country=["Austria", "Germany", "Switzerland"], 
           population=[8_917_000, 83_240_000, 8_637_000], 
           continent="Europe"
       )
3×3 DataFrame
 Row │ country      population  continent 
     │ String       Int64       String    
─────┼────────────────────────────────────
   1 │ Austria         8917000  Europe
   2 │ Germany        83240000  Europe
   3 │ Switzerland     8637000  Europe
```

Note that the continent was given as scalar "Europe" and it is broadcasted to fill every row of the created `DataFrame`.

In case you want to initialize a `DataFrame` with names that are not valid Julia identifiers (e.g. containing spaces) you can also use the following form:
```julia-repl
julia> DataFrame(
           "country" => ["Austria", "Germany", "Switzerland"], 
           "population 2020" => [8_917_000, 83_240_000, 8_637_000], 
           "continent" => "Europe"
       )
3×3 DataFrame
 Row │ country      population 2020  continent 
     │ String       Int64            String    
─────┼─────────────────────────────────────────
   1 │ Austria              8917000  Europe
   2 │ Germany             83240000  Europe
   3 │ Switzerland          8637000  Europe
```

And in case you already got your data in a dictionary, where the keys are `Strings` or `Symbols`, simply initialize your `DataFrame` using that dictionary:
```julia-repl
julia> mydict = Dict(
           "country" => ["Austria", "Germany", "Switzerland"], 
           "population 2020" => [8_917_000, 83_240_000, 8_637_000], 
           "continent" => "Europe"
       )
Dict{String, Any} with 3 entries:
  "population 2020" => [8917000, 83240000, 8637000]
  "continent"       => "Europe"
  "country"         => ["Austria", "Germany", "Switzerland"]

julia> DataFrame(mydict)
3×3 DataFrame
 Row │ continent  country      population 2020 
     │ String     String       Int64           
─────┼─────────────────────────────────────────
   1 │ Europe     Austria              8917000
   2 │ Europe     Germany             83240000
   3 │ Europe     Switzerland          8637000
```

Also note that the data types of the columns are printed below the column name.

## Working with real data

To get things more exciting, let us take a look at real data. [Stack Overflow](https://www.stackoverflow.com) provides [annual developer surveys](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/). We will have a look at the latest available data set from [2021](https://info.stackoverflowsolutions.com/rs/719-EMH-566/images/stack-overflow-developer-survey-2021.zip). Please download this file and extract it into your workspace. Note that besides the actual data there is also a file which describes the contents of the dataset.

The filename is `survey_results_public.csv` and the extension indicates that the file format is a [comma-separated values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) file. Thus, we need a package that is able to handle CSV-files. Luckily there is [CSV.jl](https://csv.juliadata.org/stable/) which makes it easy to load a file into a `DataFrame`. All we need to do is adding and loading `CSV`. Then we can read the data by using `DataFrame` as `sink` (second argument). `sink`? How do we even know that such a thing exists? It is always good to consult the manual first:
```julia-repl
pkg> add CSV
[..]
julia> using CSV

help?> CSV
search: CSV

  CSV provides fast, flexible reader & writer for delimited text files in various formats.

  Reading:

    •  CSV.File reads delimited data and returns a CSV.File object, which allows dot-access to columns and iterating rows.

    •  CSV.read is similar to CSV.File but used when the input will be passed directly to a sink function such as a DataFrame.

    •  CSV.Rows reads delimited data and returns a CSV.Rows object, which allows "streaming" the data by iterating and thereby has a lower
       memory footprint than CSV.File.

    •  CSV.Chunks allows processing extremely large files in "batches" or "chunks".

  Writing:

    •  CSV.write writes a Tables.jl interface input (https://github.com/JuliaData/Tables.jl) such as a DataFrame to a csv file or an in-memory
       IOBuffer.

    •  CSV.RowWriter creates an iterator that produces csv-formatted strings for each row in the input table.

  Here is an example of reading a csv file and passing the input to a DataFrame:

  using CSV, DataFrames
  ExampleInputDF = CSV.read("ExampleInputFile.csv", DataFrame)

  Here is an example of writing out a DataFrame to a csv file:

  using CSV, DataFrames
  ExampleOutputDF = DataFrame(rand(10,10), :auto)
  CSV.write("ExampleOutputFile.csv", ExampleOutputDF)

help?> CSV.read
  CSV.read(source, sink::T; kwargs...) => T

  Read and parses a delimited file or files, materializing directly using the sink function. Allows avoiding excessive copies of columns for certain
  sinks like DataFrame.
[..]
```

Equipped with this knowledge we are now ready to load the file:
```julia-repl
julia> df_survey = CSV.read("survey_results_public.csv", DataFrame)

```

The first thing we notice when working with real data is that there is more data than you can fit on one screen. So let us look at a couple of methods which help us to get an overview. `names(df_survey)` gives us list of columns:
```julia-repl
julia> names(df_survey)
48-element Vector{String}:
 :ResponseId
 :MainBranch
 :Employment
 :Country
 :US_State
 :UK_Country
 :EdLevel
 :Age1stCode
 ⋮
 :Sexuality
 :Ethnicity
 :Accessibility
 :MentalHealth
 :SurveyLength
 :SurveyEase
 :ConvertedCompYearly
```

Unfortunately, the vector has too many elements and also gets summarized. The full output can be shown with `show`:
```julia-repl
julia> show(names(df_survey))
["ResponseId", "MainBranch", "Employment", "Country", "US_State", "UK_Country", "EdLevel", "Age1stCode", "LearnCode", "YearsCode", "YearsCodePro", "DevType", "OrgSize", "Currency", "CompTotal", "CompFreq", "LanguageHaveWorkedWith", "LanguageWantToWorkWith", "DatabaseHaveWorkedWith", "DatabaseWantToWorkWith", "PlatformHaveWorkedWith", "PlatformWantToWorkWith", "WebframeHaveWorkedWith", "WebframeWantToWorkWith", "MiscTechHaveWorkedWith", "MiscTechWantToWorkWith", "ToolsTechHaveWorkedWith", "ToolsTechWantToWorkWith", "NEWCollabToolsHaveWorkedWith", "NEWCollabToolsWantToWorkWith", "OpSys", "NEWStuck", "NEWSOSites", "SOVisitFreq", "SOAccount", "SOPartFreq", "SOComm", "NEWOtherComms", "Age", "Gender", "Trans", "Sexuality", "Ethnicity", "Accessibility", "MentalHealth", "SurveyLength", "SurveyEase", "ConvertedCompYearly"]
```

Let us assume that we are conducting a little study on the income of different developer roles and therefore we are only interested in the columns: `["Age", "Country", "ConvertedCompYearly", "DevType", "Employment", "Ethnicity", "Gender", "OrgSize", "YearsCode"]`. Unfortunately, `ConvertedCompYearly` is not further described within the dataset schema but it is reasonably fair to assume that this reflects the annual income in dollars. Selecting various columns works with the `df_survey[!, cols]` notation:
```julia-repl
julia> selcols = ["Age", "Country", "ConvertedCompYearly", "DevType", "Employment", "Ethnicity", "Gender", "OrgSize", "YearsCode"];

julia> df_survey[!, selcols]
83439×9 DataFrame
   Row │ Age              Country                            ConvertedCompYearly  DevType                            Employment                       ⋯

                                                                                                                       5 columns and 83435 rows omitted
```

Do we notice that something odd happened? `ConvertedCompYearly` apparently is stored as a `String15` (meaning a `String` with fixed length of 15 letters) column. Taking a closer look at the data and/or CSV file, this is due to `NA` being used as text in the CSV file. We obviously want this column to be of type `Integer` (to be more precise of type `Union{Integer, Missing}`) and the `NA`s should be `missing` instead. If we would have known about this earlier, we could have corrected this right at the start when reading the dataframe. This also counts for various other problems that often occur with this file format. Non-standard separation character, different symbols for writing decimal numbers to just name two. Reading the manual of `CSV.read` tells us how we should read the data correctly and we can tell the function that we only want to read specific columns:
```julia-repl
julia> df_survey = CSV.read("survey_results_public.csv", DataFrame; missingstring="NA", select=selcols)
83439×9 DataFrame
   Row │ Employment                         Country                            YearsCode  DevType                            OrgSize                            Age  ⋯
       │ String?                            String                             String31?  String?                            String?                            Stri ⋯

```

Since `ConvertedCompYearly` is not displayed in this last output, we will take a look at the data type of the column by applying `eltype()`:
```julia-repl
julia> eltype(df_survey.ConvertedCompYearly)
Union{Missing, Int64}
 ```

 With the type `Missing` Julia provides support for representing missing values in a statistical sense. This is useful since many functions within the data science ecosystem offer options for dealing with `missing` entries, for example by allowing to skip them like in the reduction functions `mean()` or `median()` of the [`StatsBase.jl`](https://juliastats.org/StatsBase.jl/stable/) package. Find more information about this type in the [Julia documentation](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/missing/).

 Let us also have a look at the types of the rest of the columns. This unfortunately is a bit technical:
```julia-repl
 julia> collect(zip(names(df_survey), eltype.(eachcol(df_survey))))
9-element Vector{Tuple{String, Type}}:
 ("Employment", Union{Missing, String})
 ("Country", String)
 ("YearsCode", Union{Missing, String31})
 ("DevType", Union{Missing, String})
 ("OrgSize", Union{Missing, String})
 ("Age", Union{Missing, String31})
 ("Gender", Union{Missing, String})
 ("Ethnicity", Union{Missing, String})
 ("ConvertedCompYearly", Union{Missing, Int64})
 ```

Let us split up the call `collect(zip(names(df_survey), eltype.(eachcol(df_survey))))` and explain each part:
- the function `eachcol()` creates a vector-like object that allows iterating over each dataframe column,
- by using `eltype.()` we apply `eltype()` to each column, 
- this returns a vector of column types but unfortunately we can not see the according column names,
- to also get the names we use `names()`,
- `zip` ties together the $n$-th column name with the $n$-th column type, but this function also returns an iterator which can not be printed immediately,
- finally `collect()` returns an array of all items within that iterator.

\exercise{When having a look at the output it might seem like `Age`, `YearsCode` and `OrgSize` probably should also be of a numeric type. By applying `unique()` to each of these columns we will receive an array containing the unique elements within these columns. This helps us to explore the content and decide whether the columns' need to be converted to another data type. Check if the type of the columns is correct.
\solution{
```julia-repl
julia> show(unique(df_survey.Age))
Union{Missing, String31}["25-34 years old", "18-24 years old", "35-44 years old", "Prefer not to say", "45-54 years old", "Under 18 years old", "65 years or older", "55-64 years old", missing]

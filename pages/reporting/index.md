# Reporting

Presenting your (preliminary) results while developing and after the end of a project is not something that should be neglected. We humans are visual creatures and a good deal of our brain is devoted to processing visual information. Hence, putting some effort into digesting your essential conclusions and visualizing them using adequate plotting libraries really pays off.

Data science is as the name suggests based on data which usually is subject to constant change over the course of a
project. Thus, setting up a sustainable reporting pipeline that updates any figures, documents, or tables at the press of a button will save you a lot of trouble further down the road. In this lecture we will learn about the following four frameworks that should help you achieve just that.
